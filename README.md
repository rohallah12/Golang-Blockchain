# A Basic Golang Proof Of Work Blockchain - Integrated With SQLITE

# Running => go run .

# Folders  
    - blockchain => includes the core blockchain logic, for adding blocks, starting a new blockchain
    - blocks => includes the core logic for a block, Hashing data, Calculating PoW
    - consensus => includes logic for Proof of work consensus algorithm
    - DB => includes a SQLITE database which stores blocks
    - utils => extra and general functions, like error handling function

# Info
    - this is a core and basic implementation, i will be completing this project and adding more advanced features
